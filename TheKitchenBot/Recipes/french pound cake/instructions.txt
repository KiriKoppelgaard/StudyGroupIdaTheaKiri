Preheat the oven to 350F.
Butter a 9 x 5" loaf and lightly coat with flour.
Separate the eggs and place the yolks in a large bowl, then place the whites into the bowl of a stand mixer (If using a hand held mixer, just place them in another large mixing bowl).
Add the salt to the egg whites, attach the whisk attachment, and start the mixer on low speed.
Dump the sugar into the egg yolks and, using a wooden spoon, beat them together for a minute, until thick and pale yellow.
Add in the melted butter, vanilla and zest and mix well, until smooth. Add in the flour and mix until a batter just forms.
Crank the mixer to medium-high speed and beat until the egg whites reach a firm peak. Using the spoon or a spatula, fold the egg whites into the batter until just incorporated.
Scrape the batter into the prepared loaf pan and give it a few firm raps on the counter to release any trapped air bubbles.
Bake for 1 hour, or until the cake is springy to the touch and a skewer comes out with just a few moist crumbs attached.
Cool for 10 minutes in the pan before removing and cooling completely on a wire rack.
